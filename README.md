# 🚀 Overview
In this project, we analyze the business requirements of the ACCI Center, a center which holds certification exams about IT and English language. The project includes the analysis through the use of UML diagrams, such as use case diagrams, activity diagrams, class diagrams, and sequence diagrams. The project also includes the design of the database schema using MS SQL Server, and the implementation of the system using C# and ASP.NET Core.

We also implement UI application using Next.js and React.js. Visit the [Client Repository](https://github.com/pqkkkkk/ACCI_Center_Client) for more information.
